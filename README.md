# iNaturalistDatasetGenerator

I'm gradually building up the code in this repo to generate a dataset of bird calls in spectrogram format, to be used subsequently for supervised transfer learning. The final goal is to generate a model that can identify bird species from recorded calls.

The scripts here will take in '.csv' inputs generated by [iNaturalist](www.inaturalist.org) searches, parse out the URLs for the sound data, extract additional relevant metadata, and convert the sound files into spectrograms suitable for transfer learning of machine vision models

This repo is part of a larger personal project to upskill in python and machine learning, using the [Fast.ai Practical Deep Learning Course](https://course.fast.ai/).
